# 🧠 LeetCode Solutions in Python

This repository contains my solutions to selected [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems, structured as a clean  
Python project using modern tooling like Poetry and Pytest.  
Each problem is implemented as an isolated module with unit tests.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) – dependency and environment management
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) – unit testing framework
- Clean project structure with `src/` and `tests/`


## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Poetry (if not already installed)

```bash
pip install --user pipx
pipx install poetry
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```poetry install```

### 3. Run tests
```poetry run pytest```

## 🧑‍💻 Purpose
This project serves as a personal learning tool to improve algorithmic thinking and code quality.  
It also demonstrates my ability to maintain a professional-grade Python project with modern practices.
